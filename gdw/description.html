<h1>Description List</h1>

<h2>HTML Terms</h2>
<dl>
	<dt>HTML</dt><dd>Hypertext Markup Language, it is the programming language that is used to create websites.</dd>
	<dt>HTML element</dt><dd>There are two different types of elements, block-level and inline elements. Block-level marks up larger sections of a text in your document. Inline elements on the other hand are used to edit text within a paragraph or block of texts. They may only change one line or one word of text. 
        <dt>HTML tag</dt><dd>A tag is something that enclose elements, you have an open and close tag then text inbetween. However you don't have to have a close tag for every element. An example of this would be the &lt;br&gt; tag. </dd>
	<dt>Angle Bracket</dt><dd>They enclose tags and are a part of the HTML language. Because they are a part of the language they can't be typed and renderd normally on a webpage, they are special characters. Instead you must type &amp;lt for the &lt; less than symbol. To have your web page render a greater than symbol you must type &amp;gt and then a &gt; will appear. </dd>
	<dt>HTML attribute</dt><dd>Attributes are used to modify HTML elements. An example of this would be <code> &lt;element attribute=<q>value</q>&gt;element content&lt;/element&gt;</code> </dd>
	<dt>HTML comment</dt><dd>A comment is something that the programmer uses to help them organize their source code, but it is not read by the complier. It is only there to be seen by people and the computer will not see it. It is useful for labeling areas of code or leaving notes for yourself. To create a comment you type &lt;!-- your comment goes here --&gt;</dd>
	<dt>HTML object element</dt><dd>Object Elements are a special type of element, they are used to insert objects, not enclose text. They do not have a close tag beacuse there is not text to contain.</dd>
	<dt>HTML special characters</dt><dd>These are characters that are part of the HTML language and therefore can not be typed and rendered in the same way normal characters are. Instead you must use special codes. </dd>
