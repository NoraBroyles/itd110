<p>
Since &lt;,&gt; and &amp; have special meaning in HTML, you can't use these charcters to represent themselves. Instead, you need to use the so called "special characters" to represent them. For example, to have a less than sign appear in your document, you need to use <code>&amp;lt</code> to represent it.
