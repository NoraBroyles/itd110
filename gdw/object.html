<h2>Country Roads</h2>
<br>
<p>By: John Denver</p> 
<br>

<p>
 Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze
</p>

<br>
<p>
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
</p>

<br>
<p>
All my memories gather round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
</p>

<br>
<p>
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
</p>

<br>
<p>
I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
</p>

<br>
<p>
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
</p>

<br>
<p>
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
</p>

<br>
<p>
Take me home, down country roads
Take me home, down country roads
</p>
