<h1>Bob and Bill Activity</h1>
<p>Bill has not written his code properly, his error lies in his first line of 
code. He needs to change his || to &&. With the conditions he has set right now 
every price will be a great price, which is not what he wants. If he changes to 
an and then only the price within his set range will be set to true, and those 
will be the good prices.
