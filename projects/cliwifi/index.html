<p>Today I was tring to get the Pi&minus;top to connect to the interent and not
use to GUI to do so. I instead used command line to connect to my home wifi.
The commend I used was <code>sude raspi-config</code>. I then selected Network
Options, Wi&minus;fi. If you like to look for avalibe newtworks you can use
<code>sudo iwlist wlan0 scan</code>. There you can see the SSID of all avalible
networks and if they need a password. If you need more helping trying to
connect to the internet using your raspberry pi then I would advise you use <a
href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md">
this link</a>. It explains what you can do to join any network including hidden
networks.</p>
