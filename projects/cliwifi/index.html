make in this class!</p>

<p>Today I was tring to get the Pi&minus;top to connect to the interent and not
use to GUI to do so. I instead used command line to connect to my home wifi.
The commend I used was <code>sude raspi-config</code>. I then selected Network
Options, Wi&minus;fi. If you like to look for avalibe newtworks you can use
<code>sudo iwlist wlan0 scan</code>. There you can see the SSID of all avalible
networks and if they need a password. If you need more helping trying to
connect to the internet using your raspberry pi then I would advise you use <a
href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md">
this link</a>. It explains what you can do to join any network including hidden
networks.</p>

<h2>10&sol;9</h2>

<p>In class today we set up our web server using a raspberry pi 3. We first
 pulled it into monotor, key board, and ethernet cable. We fired it up and
 downloaded a web server application. After that we moved the the index.html
 that the application came with to index.back and replaced it with a new index.
 We first tried to do this using vi index.html and create a new index but then
 after messing with it for a few minutes we came to realise that vim was not 
 installed, so we installed it and then created our new index. The last step is
 to open it up to ssh and create accounts.
