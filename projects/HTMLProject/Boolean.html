<h2>What are Boolean Operations?</h2>
<p>
Boolean Operations are simply AND, OR, NOT, or AND NOT. You will soon learn whatall these terms mean. They allways return true, if the statement is true of 
false, if the statement is false. Now we will learn what each of these terms 
means.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>AND</dt>
  <dd>
      To return a value of true both items must be true. If just one item is 
      false then that will make the whole statement false. An example of an and       statement would be <q>I like cookies and milk</q> This would be true 
      because I do like both of those thing. A statement that would be <q>My 
      name is Nora AND I am 10 years old.</q> This statement would be false because 
      yes it is true that my name is Nora but I am not 10 years old, that would       make the entire statement false. 
  </dd>
  <dt>OR</dt>
  <dd>For an or statement to be ture only one of the values must be true. It 
      it will also be true if both of the values are true, the only case in 
      in which it will be false is that both statements are false. An example of      this would be <q>I am a junior in Highschool OR I go to Yorktown</q> yes 
      it is true that I am a junior but I do not go to Yorktown. So would this 
      statement be true or false. Well it would be true because one of the 
      statements is true.
  </dd>
  <dt>NOT</dt>
  <dd>A not statement is used in conjuction with either an and statement or an        or statement. It flips the value of each item within the statement. If we       were to think about this in mathematical terms we would say that NOT 
      negates the statement. It is representing as an <q>!</q> when programming
      and if it is outisde parentheseis of a statement then it will be
      distributed to each term in the statement. An example of this would be <q>      The sky is NOT purple AND The Earth is NOT flat</q> This would be a true 
      statement.

<h2>Logic Gates</h2>
<p>
A way of visually representing these statements would be through logic gates. 
Here is a chart that represents all of the combinations of Boolean statement.
