<h2>What is an Integer</h2>
<p>Well to put it simply an integer is a number! More specifically it is a whole number. 
It can be abbrivated, <q>int</q> and takes up half of the memory that a double uses, it
uses four bytes of memory or 32 bits. Integers are very important because you will use 
them in just about every program you create. One instance inwhcih you would want to use 
and integer is when counting the number of people are in an area at one time or when you
need to round number. It is useful when you need your output to be a whole number, you 
can't have half a person!

<h2>What is a Double?</h2>
<p>A double is also a way of representing a number, but it is different than an integer. 
It uses twice the amount of memory that a integer does, eight bytes or 64 bits. It takes 
up more memory because it includes floating point values &lpar; aka decimals &rpar;. You
would typically use a double when you want a more precise answer that you do not want to 
round. An example of this would be using an algorithm that calculates the circumferance ofa cirle and you want that to be exact.
